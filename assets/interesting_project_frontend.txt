### Project Title
E-Commerce Platform with Modular Architecture

### Project Overview
This project involved building a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed to serve multiple merchants, each with their own storefront. The platform was developed to provide merchants with an easy-to-use admin portal for managing products, categories, and orders, while offering customers an engaging storefront experience.

### Dual Application Structure
The platform consisted of two main applications:

1. **Admin Portal**: Allowed merchants to manage their product listings, categories, and orders. It served as the control center for all merchant operations.

2. **Storefront**: A customer-facing application where customers could browse products, add them to their cart, and place orders. Orders placed here were reflected in the admin portal for processing.

### Unified Codebase with Nx
To avoid redundancy and ensure consistency across both apps, the project was architected using **Nx**, a monorepo tool. This allowed for a modular structure, where common features and business logic were encapsulated into reusable libraries. These libraries ensured any feature developed once could be reused in both applications without duplication.

### Tech Stack
- **Front-End**: Angular, NgRx (state management), Angular Material (UI components)  
- **Monorepo**: Nx for modular and scalable codebase  
- **Cloud Storage**: Amazon S3

### Modular Libraries
The use of Nx enabled the creation of multiple domain-specific libraries:
- **Product Library**
- **Cart Library**
- **Order Library**
- **Category Library**

These ensured code reusability and consistency across the admin portal and storefront. Any update to these libraries would reflect instantly in both applications.

### Micro-Frontend Architecture
To support merchant customization, a micro-frontend architecture with a **widget-based system** was used. Merchants could customize their landing pages via drag-and-drop widgets. Configurations were stored as JSON and hosted on **Amazon S3**, making the storefront highly flexible and merchant-specific.

The same landing page could be:
- Edited in the admin portal
- Rendered in the storefront  
This provided a **unified, customizable experience**.

### Common Component Library
To maintain a consistent design, a shared **UI component library** was created and used across both apps. This ensured:
- Visual consistency
- Easier maintenance
- Faster development

### Summary
**Domain**: E-commerce, multi-tenant platforms, modular UI, frontend  
**Architecture**: Monorepo with Nx, micro-frontends, shared libraries  
**Tech Stack**: Angular, NgRx, Angular Material, S3
**Key Features**: Admin portal, storefront, widget-based landing page builder  
**Outcome**: Scalable, maintainable, and merchant-customizable platform
